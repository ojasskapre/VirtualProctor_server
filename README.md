### Problem Statement
                                      Domain: COLLEGE-APPLICATION for Parents
Build an application for college. The application should be a Chatbot wherein the parents can login and see the overall progress of their ward. The parent
can question the application in a human interact able manner. Consider an example where the parent asks as “What are the subjects this semester?” the
application should return all the subjects his ward has this SEM. After interacting with the chatbot, if the parents find that their ward’s performance
is poor then they should have a provision to send a message messag to the concerned teacher in charge and receive response on the same. The application should
also provide the various events/workshops details that are being conducted throughout the year through push notification. The application should be able
to push notification otification like results and attendance also parents should be able to digitally sign the results through the application. The information related to
placements, fees should also be accessible through the application. The college officials/teachers should also be able to send customized messages about the
student to their parents through the application either one to one or as a broadcast.
